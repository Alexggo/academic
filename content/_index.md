      title: 'ðŸ“š My Research'
      subtitle: ''
      text: |-
        As a computer biologist and Ph.D. student in Ecology and Evolution, my mission is to study the intricate evolutionary patterns between bacteria, antibiotics, and biomolecules. Through computational methods, I explore the evolution of antibiotic resistance and their biosynthetic pathways. My work not only enhances our understanding of these fundamental processes but also holds promise for practical applications.

        Areas of Focus:

        Antibiotic Resistance: I focus on the genetic and molecular mechanisms behind bacterial resistance to antibiotics. By deciphering these adaptations, I contribute to the fight against drug-resistant infections.
        
        Biosynthesis: Biomolecules are the building blocks of life. I investigate how bacteria synthesize essential compounds, uncovering novel pathways and potential targets for drug development.
        
        Education and Mentorship: Beyond research, I am passionate about nurturing the next generation of scientists. I engage with students, fostering curiosity and creativity in the dynamic field of biology.
