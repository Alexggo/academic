Hello, my name is Alejandro Gil-Gomez and I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Ecology and Evolution at Stony Brook University, where I work as a member of the Rest Lab.

My research focuses on several aspects related to molecular, genome and network evolution. In particular, I am researching the patterns and mechanisms of gene clustering evolution in antibiotic producing bacteria.

I am evaluating the Co-Regulatory and the Selfish Operon Models and their relation to the evolution of biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). I work also on phylogenetic reconciliation of BGCs as a strategy to estimate the origin of different classes of natural antibiotics.

Furthermore, my work focuses on how selection caused by antibiotics affects target and network evolution.

I also work on a metagenomics project with the aim of detecting the natural reservoir of the pathogenic fungi Candida auris.
