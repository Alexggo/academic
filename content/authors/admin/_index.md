      I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

As a computer biologist and Ph.D. candidate in Ecology and Evolution, my research focuses on the evolution of antibiotic resistance and biosynthesis. I use computational methods to study how bacteria develop resistance to antibiotics and how they produce biomolecules that are essential for their survival and growth. My work has helped to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying antibiotic resistance and biosynthesis and has the potential to inform the development of new strategies to combat bacterial infections and improve the production of biomolecules for medical and industrial applications. In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching and mentoring, and enjoy working with students to inspire their curiosity and creativity in the field of biology.
