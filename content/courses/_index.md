List of courses I have instructed as a Graduate Teaching Assistant:

### BIO 201: Fundamentals of Biology: Organisms to Ecosystems
An introduction to the major concepts in evolution, ecology, and biodiversity at the genetic, organismal, community, and ecosystem levels. Topics are presented in relation to five overall themes: Nature and Process of Science, Evolution, Information Flow, Systems, and Structure-Function. This course has been designated as a High Demand/Controlled Access (HD/CA) course. Students registering for HD/CA courses for the first time will have priority to do so.

Prerequisite: Level 4 or higher on the mathematics placement examination or Corequisite MAT 123 or higher

Advisory Prerequisite: High School Biology

DEC:     E
SBC:     SNW
3 credits

### BIO 312: Bioinformatics and Computational Biology
This course uses computational methods to analyze current problems and solutions in molecular biology research. Students are exposed to algorithms and tools available for both single gene and larger scale genome research. Emphasis is on practical application. Laboratories allow students to apply their knowledge to real life molecular biology problems.

Prerequisites: C or higher in BIO 202; and C or higher in BIO 204; and MAT 125 or higher or AMS 151

Advisory Pre- or Corequisite: AMS 110, or BIO 211

SBC:     ESI, TECH
3 credits

### BIO 367 Molecular Diversity Lab
Hands-on experience with laboratory methods to detect and analyze molecular (DNA) variation in Drosophila, bacteria, and humans as well as an introduction to examining human genetic diversity using public resources. This course has an associated fee. Please see www.stonybrook.edu/coursefees for more information.

Prerequisite: C or higher in BIO 201; C or higher in BIO 202; BIO 205 or BIO 207

Advisory Pre- or Corequisite: One of the following: BIO 320, BIO 321, BIO 351, or BIO 354
