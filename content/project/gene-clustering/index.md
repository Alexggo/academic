Hypothesis: antifungal resistance arises faster for compounds that target intracellular targets than extracellular ones. These mechanisms involve compensatory pathways, aneuploidy, efflux pumps, stress response, overexpression of targets, etc. In contrast, antifungal resistance takes longer to arise for compounds that act extracellularly, and the evolution is limited to in-situ substitutions and extracellular proteins or compensatory extracellular processes. 

### Azole resistance evolves through several mechanisms including target upregulation, aneuploidies, compensatory pathways, efflux pumps, and stress response.
Azole resistance arises through several mechanisms such as aneuploidies, upregulation of target, compensatory pathways of ergosterol biosynthesis, stress response, and efflux pump regulation (Andersson, 1999), including at least 13 amino acid substitutions in the target (Xiang, 2013). 
### Echinocandin resistance is less common and is more limited to specific substitutions in three hotspots.
In contrast, echinocandin resistance is less common than azole resistance in Candida spp (Perlin, 2007). Alternatively, evolution of echinocandin resistance is limited to in-situ modifications of the target FKS1 (Niimi, 2010). These substitutions are circumscribed to three hotspot regions in the protein that are located in the extracellular domain of the protein (Johnson, 2012). Subcellular location of the binding site of the drug might be the reason why efflux pumps arenâ€™t a common mechanism for echinocandin resistance. 
### Unsolved question: [a] Is echinocandin resistance less common because they were introduced more recently or is it due to its location?
Moreover, echinocandins were introduced later in the treatment of fungal diseases than azoles, being this a possible explanation for the limited resistance found. In order to rule out this explanation, I will perform an experimental evolution experiment on a non-resistant strain of Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
### Experimental evolution can elucidate this question and give us insights in the persistence of these changes.
Evolution in the laboratory under specific conditions is used as a research tool to understand how populations adapt to environmental conditions, to study evolutionary trade-offs and constraints, to estimate population parameters, for long-term experiments, to test evolutionary theories and is a common technique in medicine and technology (Kawecki, 2012). Using experimental evolution in this context can be very useful to elucidate how resistance originates using different antifungals, how fast do these changes occur depending on the subcellular location of the target, and their resistance to evolutionary reversion.
