Hypothesis 1: Candida auris is an environmental fungus with an avian host that acquired resistance in the environment before becoming pathogenic to humans.

Hypothesis 2: Candida auris acquired azole resistance in the environment due to use of fungicides in the agricultural sector. 

### Candida auris was an environmental fungus that recently became a human pathogen. This step caused a thermotolerance change that requires an intermediate host.

Candida auris most likely was an environmental fungus that has recently acquired pathogenicity, independently on three different continents. Its ability to grow at higher temperatures, a feature not common between environmental fungi, might be due to a selective pressure caused by warmer global temperatures (Casadevall, Kontoyiannis et al. 2019). Additionally, the transition between being an environmental fungus to a human pathogen might have been mediated by an intermediate host that facilitated the adaptation to warmer growth temperatures. It is conceivable that changes to C. auris ecological niches have brought the fungus into greater contact with susceptible humans, being transmitted from rural areas into urban centers. Clinical isolates of Candida spp. overrepresent the known diversity of Candida, but environmental diversity is less studied.

### Candida spp. are commonly found in avian hosts.

Previous work done in populations of seagulls showed that isolates of Candida glabrata identified from human and bird samples belong to the same population (Al-Yasiri, Normand et al. 2016). Many other studies have been performed, isolating Candida in other bird species have been attempted successfully in (Lord, Mohandas et al. 2010). 
Museum collections now preserve different kinds of biological material from birds, such as parasites, blood, stomach content, blood and fecal samples.

### Unsolved question: [a]  What is the natural reservoir of Candida auris in the wild?

The characterization of the secondary host that is the natural reservoir for Candida spp., might be a starting point to understand more about the natural history of Candida auris.

### Unsolved question: [b]  Was Candida auris resistant in the wild to echinocandins and azoles, or did resistance originate later during exposure to clinical treatments?

The sequencing of FKS1 and ERG11 in the samples and its comparison to resistant and non-resistant forms by looking at amino acid substitutions can inform us on whether this adaptation occured in the environment or in the hospital.
