title: "In or Out: How does subcellular location of drug targets and their domains affect the evolution of antibiotic resistance?" 
summary: This project aims to assess the effects of protein structure and subcellular location on the evolutionary rates of two antifungal targets Erg11p and Fks1p. I hypothesize that subcellular location of binding site shouldn't be overlooked when considering decisions that involve treatment or mitigation of evolutionary resistance.

Hypothesis: The evolution of Antibiotic Resistance depends on differences in evolutionary rates of the protein targets, and the subcellular location of the binding site of the compounds. 

Protein residues that are exposed to the extracellular side of the plasma membrane evolve faster than portions that are in the cytosol. As a consequence, antibiotic resistance that originates in-situ, this is through non-synonimous substitutions, should appear faster for compounds whose binding site occur extracellularly.

However, antibiotic resistance might originate through the recruitment of other cellular processes like stress response pathways, overexpression of target or transporters involved in the efflux/influx of the compound. And these mechanisms appear to have a more relevant response if the mode of action of the compound is intracellular.

To investigate this hypothesis, I compare two antifungal targets: Fks1p, whose binding site is in an extracellular domain of the protein; and Erg11p with an intracellular binding site.
